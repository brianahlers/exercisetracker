//models are going to be a way for use to create "templates" for our data so if we want to give the user 
//the ability to create a workout we can use the model to create a template for the workout and tell it what its going to populate as
// like name, reps, sets, weight, rpe, bodyweight, comments, etc. but in json format 


// exercise name
